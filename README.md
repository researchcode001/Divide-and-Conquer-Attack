## Gradio Demo:
- Download the source file `DACADemo.py` and the requirements file `requirements.txt`
- Install the required libraries: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
- Run the source file: ``python DACADemo.py``

## Gallery
The [gallery](https://github.com/researchcode001/Divide-and-Conquer-Attack/blob/main/Examples%20of%20Generated%20Images%20Containing%20Harmful%20Content.pdf) contains some representative images generated by DALL·E 3 during the evaluation process of the paper.

## Demonstration Video
The [video](https://github.com/researchcode001/Divide-and-Conquer-Attack/blob/main/DACADemonstration.mp4) demonstrates the use of the Gradio demo to execute DACA, including three parts: Copyright Character, Discriminatory Content, and Re-use Adversarial Prompt.
